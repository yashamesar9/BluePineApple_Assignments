<h3><a name=car></a>New car</h3>
<li><h2> <strong> 12th Dec 2011</strong></h2></li>
<p>Today i bought my new car. It's Honda Accord and it's really nice.
I met some friends at a pub.A new car is an automobile that is sold in 
its<br /> original manufactured condition, usually by a retail business known
 as a car dealership.The term is contrasted with used car, an automobile<br />
  which has previously had one or more owners.</p>
